If #include <stdio.h> is removed from a program that calls printf():

Stage that fails: Linking stage.

Reason:
- The compiler will allow the call to printf but will assume an implicit declaration.
- At the linking stage, the linker cannot find the actual definition of printf because the
standard library header was not included.

Expected error message:
"undefined reference to `printf`"
